# Authentication Service Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The authentication service has been refactored to achieve proper separation of concerns, removing Firebase SDK dependencies and implementing direct Google Identity Platform REST API calls.

## Architecture Changes

### Before
- Single `AuthenticationService` that mixed:
  - External API calls (Firebase SDK)
  - Database operations (UserRepository)
  - Authentication logic
- Firebase SDK dependency

### After
- **Google Identity Platform Client** (`/src/external/client/gcp/identity-platform.ts`)
  - Pure REST API client
  - No Firebase SDK dependencies
  - Handles all Google Identity Platform API calls

- **AuthenticationService** (`/src/external/service/auth/AuthenticationService.ts`)
  - Authentication logic only
  - Delegates to GCP client for external calls
  - No database operations

- **UserManagementService** (`/src/external/service/auth/UserManagementService.ts`)
  - User database operations only
  - No external API calls
  - Permission management

- **Handler** (`/src/external/handler/auth.ts`)
  - Coordinates between services
  - Cookie management
  - Audit logging

## Key Files Created/Modified

### Created
1. `/src/external/client/gcp/identity-platform.ts` - Google Identity Platform REST API client
2. `/src/external/service/auth/AuthenticationService.ts` - Pure authentication service
3. `/src/external/service/auth/UserManagementService.ts` - User management service
4. `/src/external/service/auth/index.ts` - Service exports
5. `/src/external/service/auth/README.md` - Architecture documentation
6. `/src/external/service/auth/__tests__/` - Example test files

### Modified
1. `/src/external/handler/auth.ts` - Updated to use new services
2. `/src/external/service/index.ts` - Updated exports
3. `/.env.example` - Added new environment variables

### Backup
- `/src/external/service/AuthenticationService.old.ts` - Original service (backup)

## Environment Variables

New required environment variables:
```env
# Google Identity Platform
GCP_API_KEY=your-gcp-api-key
GCP_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-oauth-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-oauth-client-secret
```

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **No Firebase SDK**: Direct REST API calls to Google Identity Platform
3. **Testability**: Services can be tested independently with proper mocking
4. **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries between external APIs and business logic
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to swap authentication providers or add new ones

## Migration Notes

- The old `AuthenticationService` has been backed up as `AuthenticationService.old.ts`
- All Firebase imports have been removed
- The handler now coordinates between multiple services instead of using a single monolithic service
- Cookie storage now includes separate tokens for authentication and refresh

## Testing

Example test files demonstrate how to test the new architecture:
- Mock only the external clients, not entire services
- Test authentication logic separately from user management
- Clear separation allows for focused unit tests
